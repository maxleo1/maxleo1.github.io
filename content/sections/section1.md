## About [ALF]

[Cardano](https://cardano.org) is a cryptocurrency based on a proof of stake decentralized public blockchain.

Delegating Cardano holdings to a stakepool results in receiving rewards directly from the network while the holdings stay in the owner's wallet. Rewards are generated by transaction costs in the blockchain plus reserves in the treasury. An overview of Cardano stakepools is provided at [adapools.org](https://adapools.org/). 

[ALF] is maintained by a finance professional with DevOps experience.
